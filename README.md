# FitbitAnalysis

## Description
In this project, I analyze my personal Fitbit data to look for trends relating to days of the week and temperature data. In it, I create visualizations, conduct hypothesis tests, and use two types of classification to make predictions about my dataset.

## Parts of the code
Project.ipynb: This file contains the most important pieces of the code, as well as all the results and explanations/analysis.  
utils.py: This file contains the utility code, which is unrelated to the analysis or insights.  
fitbit_data_aug-oct.csv: This .csv file contains my Fitbit data from August 1st to October 31st.  
Day of Week.csv: This .csv file contains the day of the week for each day August through October.

## Running the code
In order to run the code, all four files above must be in the same file. Running all cells in Project.ipynb will run the entirety of the code and display all relevant results and output.
